  ui_main_menu_about_early_access_message: >
    Thank you for deciding to give our game a try!
    

    This game is about surviving, it's about starting in a primordial broth as a single cell and make your
    way into life by creating all the production chain needed!

    Our final vision is to evolve from a simple cell to a fully mammal creature with organs:
    a circulatory system, a respiratory system, a digestive system, a nervous system, and so on..
    all of this by building and expanding and evolving your initiali organism!
    
    Have fun with this EA! We want your feedback so please join our Discord and find us there. We need your help :)
